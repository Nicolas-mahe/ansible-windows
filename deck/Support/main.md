## Ansible Concepts

![bg right 40%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Ansible_logo.svg)

---

### What is Ansible ?

- Open source
- Based on Python
- Created in 2012 and acquired by Red Hat in 2015
- Tool for machine provisioning, configuration and deployment
- Agentless
- Idempotence, stateless

---

### Ansible Communication Protocoles

- Ansible + Linux (or Mac) ðŸ‘‰ SSH
- Ansible + Windows ðŸ‘‰
  - WinRM: **Win**dows **R**emote **M**anagement
  - SSH (:warning: Experimental)

---

### WinRM

- **Win**dows **R**emote **M**anagement: Used by Ansible to to communicate with Windows machines.
- WinRM default ports
  - HTTP : 5985
  - HTTPS : 5986 (SSL certificats required)
- SSH default port is 22
- ðŸ›ˆ The python module **`pywinrm`** is required by ansible for Windows support.

---

#### WinRM and Authentification

- Basic
- Certificate
- NTLM
- Kerberos
- CredSSP

---

#### WinRM and Authentification: Basic

- The simplest authentication options to use,
- Can only be used for local accounts (not domain accounts).

---

#### WinRM and Authentification: Certificate

- Authentication uses certificates as key, similar to SSH key pairs
- Not enabled by default on a Windows host

---

#### WinRM and Authentification: NTLM

- Enabled by default on the WinRM service
- Support local and domain users
- More secure than Basic

ðŸ›ˆ We will use **NTLM** on our labs

---

#### WinRM and Authentification: Kerberos

- Recommended when running on a domain environment
- Support message encryption over HTTP and credential delegation
- The most secure available on WinRM service
- Ansible controller require configuration
- The wrapper **pywinrm[kerberos]** is required

---

#### WinRM and Authentification: CredSSP

- New authentication protocol that allows credential delegation
- Support message encryption over HTTP
- The wrapper **pywinrm[credssp]** is required

---

### Ansible :heart: PowerShell

- Ansible can execute PowerShell commands/files
  - Ansible required powershell 3.0+ and .NET 4.0+ on target hosts
- Ansible modules for Windows are based on PowerShell ðŸ‘‰ `ansible.windows`

## Ansible Project

---

### Ansible Configuration

- Ansible comes with a default configuration `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`.
- This configuration can be overriden with the following precedence:
  - The env variable: `ANSIBLE_CONFIG`
  - The file `ansible.cfg` on your current directory where ansible is executed
  - User home directory: `~/.ansible/ansible.cfg`
  - Default `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` file.

---

### Inventories

- File that describes your infrastructure: Contant machines and their variables
- Machines can be grouped by type: db, frontend, backend...
- Multiple format to define an inventory:
  - ini
  - yaml
  - json

---

### Inventory structure

```plain
â”œâ”€â”€ inventories
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ dev
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ group_vars
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ all.yml
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ backend.yml
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ host_vars
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ db01.yml
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ backend01.yml
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ backend02.yml
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ frontend01.yml
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ hosts
```

---

### Inventory hosts file

```ini
[db]           # group name
db01           # machine name

[backend]
backend0[1:2]  # use range to simplify backend01 and backend02

[frontend]
frontend01
```

---

### Variables

- We can declare variables in an Ansible project
- No need to specify the variable type (int, string, etc ...)
- You can call a variable inside another one (put it between {{ }})

```yml
my_variable_name: "my_variable_value"
my_second_variable_name: "my_second_variable_value {{ my_variable_name }}"
# ansible will interpret anything inside {{ }}
```

---

### Secret Management with Ansible Vault

- To deal with sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, certificats..., we have to use the cli `Ansible-vault` to encrypt them.
- The enrypted data can be distributed or placed in `source control` (gitlab, tfs, ...).

---

## Let's create an Ansible inventory with secrets

ðŸ§ª Lab 03

---

### Playbook

- An ansible playbook is a yaml file that triggers the actions to be performed by Ansible on an inventory ðŸ‘‰ Orchestrate

```yml
---
- name: My awesome playbook
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - create-vm
    - install-database
```

```bash
ansible-playbook deploy.yml -i inventories/dev
```

---

### Roles

Roles let you automatically load related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure. After you group your content in roles, you can easily reuse them and share them with other users.

---

#### Role's structure

- meta: Metadata of the role
- defaults: Default variables of the role
- vars: Other variables used by the roles and can be overridden by a user
- tasks: Set of tasks used by the role
- handlers: Handlers triggered used by the tasks of the role
- files: Static files used by the role
- templates: Templates based on jinja and used by the role

---

#### Create a role

- You can create the skeleton of an ansible role using the cli `ansible-galaxy`:

```bash
ansible-galaxy init roles/create-vm
```

---

```plain
â”œâ”€â”€ roles
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ create-vm
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ defaults
â”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.yml
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ files
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ handlers
â”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.yml
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ meta
â”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.yml
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ tasks
â”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.yml
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ templates
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ vars
â”‚Â Â          â””â”€â”€ main.yml
```

## Ansible Collections

---

- With Ansible Collections, you can use ansible playbooks/roles created and maintained by the community.
- Example: Microsoft provides an ansible collection [`azure.azcollection`](https://github.com/ansible-collections/azure) that allows to provisionne and configure Azure ressources using Ansible

---

## [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/)

Ansible Galaxy or Galaxy is a hub for finding and sharing Ansible content

### How to install ansible collections ?

Install a role

```shell
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.java
```

Install a collection

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install azure.azcollection
```

Or install multiple collections/roles with a requirements file

```shell
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

---

```yml
---
roles:
  # Install a role from Ansible Galaxy.
  - name: geerlingguy.java
    version: "1.9.6" # note that ranges are not supported for roles

collections:
  # Install a role from Ansible Galaxy.
  - name: install azure.azcollection
    version: ">=1.14.0" # usage of ranges
  # Install a role from Ansible Galaxy.
  - name: awx.awx
    version: 21.11.0
    source: https://galaxy.ansible.com
  # Install a role from a git branch/tag/commit
  - name: https://github.com/organization/repo_name.git
    type: git
    version: develop
```

## Best Practices

---

### Ansible Lint

- Ansible Lint is a command-line tool for linting playbooks, roles and collections
- Promotes best pratices
- Helps you to upgrade your code to work with newer versions of Ansible
- Automated lint on pull requests checks (ci pipelines)

:information_source: VSCode extension for Ansible (for windows users ðŸ‘‰ `WSL is required`)

---

### Use Ansible FQCN

- FQCN ðŸ‘‰ Fully Qualified Collection Name
- Recommended since Ansible 2.10

```yml
- name: Task not using FQCN
  win_command: whoami
```

```yml
- name: Task using FQCN
  ansible.windows.win_command: whoami
```

---

### Usage of tags

If you have a large playbook, it may be useful to run/skip only specific parts of it instead of running the entire playbook. You can do this with Ansible tags:

```yml
---
- name: Install all critical and security updates
  ansible.windows.win_updates:
    category_names:
    - SecurityUpdates
    state: installed
  tags: patching
```

```bash
Ansible-playbook deploy.yml --tags "patching"
Ansible-playbook deploy.yml --skip-tags "patching"
```

---

### Smoke tests

- After a deployment on a target node, it's a good practice to run checks on new/updated compnents to verify that they are running and healty.
- The goal is to get information as soon as possible.
- Theses tests are called `smoke tests`
- An example of smoke tests : After deploying an api with ansible, the playbook should
  - Check if the authentication endpoint works
  - Call the api to query data
  - ...
